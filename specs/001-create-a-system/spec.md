# Feature Specification: JIRA Change Data Capture System

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a system that performs Change Data Capture for JIRA changes into git storage. It should be deployable on kubernetes. It should be possible to monitor the tasks its performing. It should have an API that allows new bootstrap or consistency reconciliation tasks to be started, monitored for status. There should be a light-weight but polished user interface that uses React and Patternfly 6."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a senior product manager leading an agentic swarm development initiative, I need JIRA work items (RFEs, Features, Epics, User Stories, Tasks, Bugs) continuously mirrored in git repositories so that autonomous agents can access structured project context while maintaining JIRA as the authoritative source of truth. Humans refine and iterate on agent-generated deliverables in JIRA, and agents consume the updated git-mirrored data to execute implementation tasks. This enables a spec-driven development flow where agents work with current, human-validated requirements while preserving complete change history and traceability for both human oversight and agent memory continuity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JIRA project with active issues, **When** the CDC system is deployed and configured for that project, **Then** all current non-closed issues are synchronized to a git repository within the expected timeframe
2. **Given** the CDC system is running, **When** a JIRA issue is created, updated, or transitioned, **Then** the corresponding change is reflected in the git repository within minutes
3. **Given** the system detects data inconsistencies, **When** an operator initiates a reconciliation task through the web interface, **Then** the system corrects the inconsistencies and provides progress feedback
4. **Given** a new JIRA project needs to be synchronized, **When** an operator configures a new bootstrap task, **Then** the system creates a new git repository and begins synchronizing all active issues with progress tracking
5. **Given** the system is processing tasks, **When** an operator views the monitoring dashboard, **Then** they can see real-time status of all running operations, system health metrics, and historical sync performance
6. **Given** a JIRA project with RFEs, Features, and User Stories, **When** the CDC system is deployed, **Then** all active work items are synchronized to a git repository that agents can consume as a read-only submodule in their development workflows
7. **Given** a human product manager updates a User Story in JIRA after agent refinement, **When** the change is committed, **Then** the updated requirements are available in git within minutes for subsequent agent tasks
8. **Given** agents are working on implementation tasks, **When** they reference the git-mirrored JIRA data, **Then** they access the most current human-validated specifications and acceptance criteria
9. **Given** a new Epic is broken down into User Stories by agent-human collaboration, **When** the breakdown is finalized in JIRA, **Then** the complete hierarchy is reflected in git with proper linking for agent context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JIRA becomes temporarily unavailable during synchronization?
- How does the system handle JIRA issues that are moved between projects?
- What occurs when git repository storage becomes full or inaccessible?
- How are conflicting updates handled if JIRA data changes rapidly?
- What happens when the Kubernetes pod is restarted during a long-running bootstrap operation?
- What happens when agents attempt to access JIRA data via git submodules during synchronization outages?
- How does the system handle rapid iteration cycles where humans update JIRA specifications while agents are actively working on related tasks?
- What occurs when JIRA work items are restructured (moved between projects, re-parented) during active agent development workflows?
- How are validation state conflicts resolved when both agents and humans modify related JIRA content simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously monitor JIRA for issue changes and capture them in git repositories
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a bootstrap operation that synchronizes all active issues from a JIRA project to a new git repository
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a reconciliation operation that detects and corrects data inconsistencies between JIRA and git
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose an API for starting, stopping, and monitoring bootstrap and reconciliation tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress tracking for long-running operations with percentage completion
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain one git file per JIRA issue using the issue key as the primary identifier
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize git repository structure to reflect JIRA issue hierarchy using symbolic links
- **FR-008**: System MUST commit changes using conventional commit message format for traceability
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize active (non-closed) issues during initial synchronization
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement graceful error handling with exponential backoff for JIRA API rate limits
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a web-based user interface for monitoring system status and managing tasks
- **FR-012**: System MUST support deployment and scaling in Kubernetes environments
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for operational monitoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST support resumable operations if interrupted during execution
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all CDC operations with appropriate detail for troubleshooting
- **FR-016**: System MUST structure git repositories to support read-only submodule consumption by agent development workflows
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve JIRA issue hierarchy and relationships in git structure to maintain agent context fidelity
- **FR-018**: System MUST support spec-driven development flows by maintaining complete change history for agent memory persistence
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide git metadata that enables agents to identify human-validated vs agent-generated content in JIRA items

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JIRA Work Item**: RFEs, Features, Epics, User Stories, Tasks, or Bugs that serve as the authoritative source of truth for agent development workflows
- **Agent-Accessible Repository**: Git repository structured as a read-only submodule containing current, human-validated JIRA content for agent consumption
- **Human-Agent Collaboration Cycle**: The iterative process where agents generate content, humans refine it in JIRA, and agents consume updated specifications
- **CDC Task**: A unit of work representing either bootstrap synchronization or reconciliation operations with status tracking
- **Spec-Driven Context**: Complete change history and hierarchical relationships that enable agent memory persistence and context awareness
- **Validation State**: Metadata indicating whether JIRA content represents human-validated specifications vs agent-generated proposals
- **Submodule Integration Point**: The interface where agent development workflows incorporate the mirrored JIRA data as dependency context
