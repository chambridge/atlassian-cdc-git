# Feature Specification: JIRA Change Data Capture System

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a system that performs Change Data Capture for JIRA changes into git storage. It should be deployable on kubernetes. It should be possible to monitor the tasks its performing. It should have an API that allows new bootstrap or consistency reconciliation tasks to be started, monitored for status. There should be a light-weight but polished user interface that uses React and Patternfly 6."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team lead, I want to have a real-time, searchable mirror of our JIRA project data stored in git repositories so that I can track project evolution over time, perform historical analysis, and maintain data continuity even if JIRA becomes unavailable. The system should automatically capture all JIRA changes and provide a user-friendly interface to monitor synchronization health and initiate data recovery operations when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JIRA project with active issues, **When** the CDC system is deployed and configured for that project, **Then** all current non-closed issues are synchronized to a git repository within the expected timeframe
2. **Given** the CDC system is running, **When** a JIRA issue is created, updated, or transitioned, **Then** the corresponding change is reflected in the git repository within minutes
3. **Given** the system detects data inconsistencies, **When** an operator initiates a reconciliation task through the web interface, **Then** the system corrects the inconsistencies and provides progress feedback
4. **Given** a new JIRA project needs to be synchronized, **When** an operator configures a new bootstrap task, **Then** the system creates a new git repository and begins synchronizing all active issues with progress tracking
5. **Given** the system is processing tasks, **When** an operator views the monitoring dashboard, **Then** they can see real-time status of all running operations, system health metrics, and historical sync performance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JIRA becomes temporarily unavailable during synchronization?
- How does the system handle JIRA issues that are moved between projects?
- What occurs when git repository storage becomes full or inaccessible?
- How are conflicting updates handled if JIRA data changes rapidly?
- What happens when the Kubernetes pod is restarted during a long-running bootstrap operation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously monitor JIRA for issue changes and capture them in git repositories
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a bootstrap operation that synchronizes all active issues from a JIRA project to a new git repository
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a reconciliation operation that detects and corrects data inconsistencies between JIRA and git
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose an API for starting, stopping, and monitoring bootstrap and reconciliation tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress tracking for long-running operations with percentage completion
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain one git file per JIRA issue using the issue key as the primary identifier
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize git repository structure to reflect JIRA issue hierarchy using symbolic links
- **FR-008**: System MUST commit changes using conventional commit message format for traceability
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize active (non-closed) issues during initial synchronization
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement graceful error handling with exponential backoff for JIRA API rate limits
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a web-based user interface for monitoring system status and managing tasks
- **FR-012**: System MUST support deployment and scaling in Kubernetes environments
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for operational monitoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST support resumable operations if interrupted during execution
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all CDC operations with appropriate detail for troubleshooting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JIRA Project**: A collection of issues in JIRA that will be synchronized to a corresponding git repository
- **CDC Task**: A unit of work representing either bootstrap synchronization or reconciliation operations with status tracking
- **Git Repository**: Target storage location mirroring JIRA project data with one file per issue
- **Sync Status**: Current state of synchronization including progress, errors, and health metrics
- **Issue Mapping**: The relationship between JIRA issue keys and their corresponding git file paths and symbolic link structure
- **Task Progress**: Real-time tracking information including items processed, total items, percentage complete, and estimated time remaining
- **System Configuration**: Settings for JIRA connection, git repository targets, rate limits, and operational parameters
