# MVP Planning: JIRA Change Data Capture System

**Related Specification**: `spec.md`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft Implementation Planning  

## MVP Scope Definition
**Product Manager & Senior Architect Decision**: The minimum viable product focuses on core CDC functionality with basic agent integration. Advanced features like complex hierarchy management, sophisticated UI, and full agent workflow integration are deferred to future releases.

## MVP Success Criteria
- Single JIRA project â†’ single git repository synchronization working reliably
- Agents can consume git-mirrored JIRA data via basic file structure
- Basic monitoring and health checks functional
- Deployable on Kubernetes with standard configuration

## MVP Performance Targets
- Bootstrap: <30 minutes for JIRA projects with <1000 active issues
- Real-time sync: <5 minutes from JIRA change to git commit
- System availability: 99.5% uptime during business hours
- Storage efficiency: <10MB git repository size per 100 JIRA issues

## MVP Constraints & Assumptions
- Single JIRA instance support (staging OR production, not both)
- Maximum 1000 active issues per project (larger projects deferred to Release 2.0)
- Polling-only synchronization (webhook integration complexity deferred)
- Flat file structure (symbolic link hierarchy complexity deferred)
- Basic error handling (advanced resilience patterns deferred)
- Manual scaling (auto-scaling complexity deferred)

## MVP Timeline
**12-16 weeks for core functionality**

## MVP Risk Mitigation
- Prototype JIRA API integration in weeks 1-2 to validate rate limits
- Early git repository structure validation with sample agent workflows
- Kubernetes deployment template ready by week 4 for early testing

## Requirements Prioritization

### Core MVP Requirements *(Release 1.0)*
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously monitor JIRA for issue changes and capture them in git repositories
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a bootstrap operation that synchronizes all active issues from a JIRA project to a new git repository  
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain one git file per JIRA issue using the issue key as the primary identifier
- **FR-008**: System MUST commit changes using conventional commit message format for traceability
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize active (non-closed) issues during initial synchronization
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement graceful error handling with exponential backoff for JIRA API rate limits
- **FR-012**: System MUST support deployment and scaling in Kubernetes environments
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for operational monitoring
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all CDC operations with appropriate detail for troubleshooting
- **FR-016**: System MUST structure git repositories to support read-only submodule consumption by agent development workflows

### MVP Implementation Clarifications
- Single JIRA project support only (multi-project deferred to Release 2.0)
- Basic flat file structure (complex hierarchy via symbolic links deferred)
- API monitoring via health endpoints (full web UI deferred)
- Manual reconciliation triggers via API (automatic detection deferred)

### Enhanced Features *(Release 2.0+)*
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a reconciliation operation that detects and corrects data inconsistencies between JIRA and git
- **FR-004**: System MUST expose an API for starting, stopping, and monitoring bootstrap and reconciliation tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress tracking for long-running operations with percentage completion
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize git repository structure to reflect JIRA issue hierarchy using symbolic links
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a web-based user interface for monitoring system status and managing tasks
- **FR-014**: System MUST support resumable operations if interrupted during execution
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve JIRA issue hierarchy and relationships in git structure to maintain agent context fidelity
- **FR-018**: System MUST support spec-driven development flows by maintaining complete change history for agent memory persistence
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide git metadata that enables agents to identify human-validated vs agent-generated content in JIRA items

## MVP Edge Case Simplifications

### Handled in MVP
- JIRA outages: Basic exponential backoff with health status reporting
- Rapid updates: Simple polling strategy with conflict resolution via timestamps
- Agent access during outages: Stale-but-functional data with basic staleness indicators

### Deferred to Release 2.0+
- Cross-project issue moves (MVP supports single project only)
- Storage failover and advanced resilience (MVP uses standard Kubernetes storage)
- Pod restart resumability (MVP restarts bootstrap from beginning)
- Complex agent workflow integration (MVP provides basic file access only)
- Advanced conflict resolution workflows (MVP focuses on basic CDC functionality)

## Architectural Note
MVP deliberately simplifies edge case handling to focus on core CDC reliability. Advanced scenarios require additional infrastructure and complexity that exceeds MVP scope. This approach ensures rapid delivery of core value while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
